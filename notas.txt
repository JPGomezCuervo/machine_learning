Machine learning types:
a) supervised learning.
b) unsupervised learning.

Supervised Learning Algorithms
        * Regresion -> predicts a number of infinetly possible answers. Usually a number.
        * Classification -> predicts categories from a small number of possible answers.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
        * Clustering -> groups similar data.
        * Anomaly detection -> finds unusual data points.
        * Dimensionality reduction -> compress data.

#### SOME JARGON ###
Training set -> dataset used for training the model.
x -> feature/input variable.
y -> target/output, variable.
m -> total number of training examples.
(x^i, y^i) -> refers to an specific training example. 'i' is for index.
